## About Road Scene Graph

Road scene graph is a special scene-graph for intelligent vehicles. Different to classical data representation, this graph provided not only object proposals but also their pair-wise relationships. 
 
By organizing them in a topological graph, these data are user-friendly, explainable, and could be easily processed by GCNs (Graph convolutional network). Here we initially apply scene graph on roads, brought out Road Scene Graph dataset

## When will this dataset become available?

Coming soon, maybe after the review process of ICRA21.
